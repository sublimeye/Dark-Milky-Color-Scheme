= WebStorm / PhpStorm IDE settings

== Dark color theme for JetBrains products (phpstorm, webstorm)

Hi there. Here you can find my personal settings for the phpStorm/webStorm IDEs.Everyone can use them for free and share among other developers :)

- sublimeye_settings.jar contains all settings for the IDE (incl. code style, live templates, File Types etc)
- sublimeye_settings[dark_color_theme_1.0].jar contains only color theme settings. It's a nice dark color theme. It's partially based on Monokai theme plus a lot of my own preferences.

Here is an example of the color theme:
(js file, html, css)

_I didn't modified colors for some languages, e.g. CoffeeScript, HAML
